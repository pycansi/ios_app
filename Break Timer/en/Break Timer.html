<h1>App Name</h1>
<p>Break Timer</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>No ads or in-app purchases. Gentle notifications, not harsh alerts.</p> 
<p>No matter how busy you are at work, don’t forget to take breaks. Set a countdown while working — once the time is up, a notification will pop up. When you see it, you’ll know it’s time to rest~ After your break, a simple tap starts a new session~</p> 
<p>While scrolling through your phone, set a timer before you start. When time’s up, a reminder will appear — stand up, stretch your body, and look into the distance. Good for your health~</p>
